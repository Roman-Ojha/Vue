*) Key attribute
    -> A command Practice and also recommended to provide a key attribute with the v-for directive
    -> Key is a special attribute which is primarily used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify nodes which diffing the new DOM tree with the old DOM tree
    -> The key attribute helps Vue identify which items in a list have changed, are added or removed and plays a crucial role in handling UI updates correctly and efficiently
    -> The key special attribute is primarily used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify nodes when diffing the new list of nodes against the old list
    -> When used with the v-for directive, the key attribute should alway have a unique value in each iteration
    -> Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimized element movement and tries to patch/reuse element of the same type in-place as much as possible
    -> Not using key is only suitable when your list render output does not rely on temporary DOM state or child component state
    -> Although the default behavior of patching is more efficient, it can lead to problems
    -> A typical value to provide to the key attribute is the id property in a object. But any unique property will do as long as its not non-primitive value like object or arrays
