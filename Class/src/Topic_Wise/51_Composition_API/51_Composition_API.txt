*) Composition API:
    -> What is the Composition API?
        -> The Composition API is a feature in Vue 3 which gives us another way to write our components
        -> More specifically, the script bloc in the component
        -> Options API -data(), computed properties, methods, watcher & lifecycle hooks
        -> What we've learned so far is the Options API which is only way to build components in Vue
        -> The other way is to use the composition API
    -> Why Composition API?
        1> Vue projects become hard to manage as they grew in size and complexity
            -> Logic isn't really grouped by feature, which can make it hard to read through a large and complex component file.
        2> Re-using logic across components become difficult
    -> Composition API allows us to encapsulate one piece of functionality so that you can use it in different components throughout the application
