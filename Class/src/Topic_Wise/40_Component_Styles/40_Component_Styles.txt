*) Component Styles:
    -> By default, a Component styles are applied globally in the component tree
    -> Scoped attribute ensures a component's CSS will apply only to it's own HTML element
    -> "With scoped, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components. However, a child component's root node will be affected by both the parent's scoped CSS and the Child's scoped CSS. This is by design so that the parent can style the child root element for layout purposes"
        -> and if you want to avoid this miner detail the solution is to use 'CSS module'
    -> When using slots, the parent component styles are applied and no the child component styles even though the content is embedded inside the child component
