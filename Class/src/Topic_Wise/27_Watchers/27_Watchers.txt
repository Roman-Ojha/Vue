*) Watchers:
    -> Allow you to watch any data or computed property and execute some code in response to change in the value
    -> Example:
        *> Implement a volume tracker
            -> See the current volume level
            -> Increase or decrease the volume level

*) Watcher vs Computed Properties:
    Q) Can we use watcher instead fo computed properties?
        -> Yes. Watcher simply provide a more generic way to react to data changes
        -> However, it is not recommended to mimic a computed property as a watcher

    -> Use computed properties when:
        1) You need to compose new data from existing data sources
        2) You need to reduce the length of a variable
    -> Use watcher when:
        1) You have to check if a property have changed to favorable value to know if you're ready to perform an action
        2) You have to call and API in response to change in application data
        3) You have to apply transition
