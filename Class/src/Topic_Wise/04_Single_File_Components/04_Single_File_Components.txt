*) .Vue File?
    -> A *.vue file is a custom file format that uses HTMl-like syntax to describe a portion of the UI
    -> Each *.vue file consists of three types of top-level language blocks
        1) <template></template>
            -> The template bloc is like the HTMl of you UI
        2) <script></script>
            -> The script Bloc is where logic and functionality of you app can be maintained
        3) <style></style>
            -> The Style/CSS block is where you specify the styles related to the mark up in the template block
