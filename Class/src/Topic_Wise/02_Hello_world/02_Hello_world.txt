*) Four way to add Vue:
    1) CDN Package
        -> incorporate Vue into a really old legacy code base or quickly prototype
        -> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
    2) npm:
        -> npm install vue
        ->  Preferred approach over CDN when build large scale application with Vue.
    3) Vue CLI -> implement this approach for this tutorial
        -> Vue provides and official CLI for quickly scaffolding single page applications
        -> npm install -g @vue/cli
        -> vue create <project-name>
    4) Vite
        -> an opinionated Web deve build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports
        -> Your code is served at a lightning fast speed and you get nearly instant hot module replacement
        -> npm init vite-app <project_name>
    
*) Setup:
